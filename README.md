Here I am learning Javascript by The Great Guessing RGB Color Game


in this game i learn some math syntaxes such as 
.

	Math.random() and Math.floor()

also, learn about looping using this syntax
.

	for('initializer'; 'condition'; 'final expression') {
    	'your_execute_wish)
	}



and many more!
